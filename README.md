# expanding-cards
Responsive expanding card layout with smooth animations, mobile slider support, and accessibility features.

This project is a responsive Expanding Cards UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- On desktop, cards expand on click to reveal more details.
- On mobile, the layout switches to a horizontal slider with optional vertical-to-horizontal scroll conversion for touch devices.

Designed with semantic HTML, BEM-based class naming, and accessible controls (keyboard navigation, aria labels, reduced motion support).
Includes smooth CSS animations and modern layout techniques (clamp(), min(), dvh).
